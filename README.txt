The dataset used in this project includes Louisville-area 
health inspection violations covering May 2010 to March 2019.
It can be found at https://data.louisvilleky.gov.


Using this data, I sought to answer the question: 
"Which Louisville-area zipcode receives the highest number of 
poor initial health inspection ratings in its restaurants and 
eating establishments?"

Looking at the dataset provided by the city of Louisville, I was 
able to see a score for each time the health inspector visited an 
eating establishment, along with names and addresses of each 
location.

Not wanted to get lost in the weeds paying attention to the good 
scores, I filtered down to the first scores received, before there 
was time to improve. Looking at only these initial scores, I then 
filtered down to the low end, ultimately resting on the scores of 
82 and below. Out of that group, there is a clear cut winner.
